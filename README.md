This is the Hello World tutorial

OK I am not going to be funny here, life is to short for that. I prefer to laugh before I go to bed, then my sleep is more peaceful. During the day, I tend to be edgy, especially when anything with the potential to get on my nerves DOES get on my nerves. Apart from that, I have many friends who don't mind.
